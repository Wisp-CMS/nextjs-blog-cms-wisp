This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) blogging starter template. This version is using Next.js 15 App Router with [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components) and uses [Wisp](https://wisp.blog/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=nextjs-blog-cms-wisp) for publishing blog posts.

Probably the most feature-rich Next.js blog template out there that is easily configurable and customizable. It's perfect as an upgrade from blogs using Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Contentlayer, or ContentCollections.

## Quick Start Guide

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

**IMPORTANT**: There's a dependency (next-themes) that's not upgraded to React 19 so you will need to add the `--legacy-peer-deps` into the install command. Make sure that Vercel's install command is set to use `npm i --legacy-peer-deps` too!

Then, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Note: You will need to populate the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOG_ID` variable with the Blog ID obtained from wisp after you've created an account.

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
